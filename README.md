# ML_Project-üè™Big_Mart_Sales_Predictionüè™

This project tackles the task of predicting sales figures for products at Bid Mart using XGBRegressor, a powerful machine learning technique. By analyzing historical sales data and product attributes, the model aims to identify patterns that can be used to forecast future sales performance.

### data
This directory stores the Bid Mart sales data in CSV format. It's assumed the dataset contains attributes like:
  - Item_Identifier (unique identifier for a loan application, can be ignored or used for tracking purposes)
  - Item_Weight (not directly relevant to loan assessment)
  - Item_Fat_Content (not directly relevant to loan assessment)
  - Item_Visibility (not directly relevant to loan assessment)
  - Item_Type (not directly relevant to loan assessment)
  - Item_MRP (not directly relevant to loan assessment)  **You can remove these attributes if they are not relevant.**
  - Outlet_Identifier (not directly relevant to loan assessment)  **You can remove this attribute if it's not relevant.**
  - Outlet_Establishment_Year (not directly relevant to loan assessment)  **You can remove this attribute if it's not relevant.**
  - Outlet_Size (not directly relevant to loan assessment)  **You can remove this attribute if it's not relevant.**
  - Outlet_Location_Type (not directly relevant to loan assessment)  **You can remove this attribute if it's not relevant.**
  - Outlet_Type (not directly relevant to loan assessment)  **You can remove this attribute if it's not relevant.**
  - Item_Outlet_Sales (not directly relevant to loan assessment)  **You can remove this attribute if it's not relevant.**

 **notebooks**: This directory contains the Jupyter Notebook (`bid_mart_sales_prediction.ipynb`) for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

 ### Running the Project
The main script (main.py or similar) typically follows these steps:
  1. Load the data: Load the Big Mart dataset using appropriate libraries.
  2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for modeling. This might involve handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and potentially encoding categorical features (if present).
  3. Split Data: Divide the data into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the logistic regression model, and the testing set evaluates its performance on unseen data.
  4. Model Training: Train the XGBRegressor model on the training data.
  5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  6. (Optional) Model Saving: Save the trained model for future use.
     
 ### Additional Notes
  - This project showcases xgbregressor using big mart sales prediction. You can explore other machine learning models and hyperparameter tuning for potentially better results.
  - Feel free to modify the code to experiment with different functionalities, like making predictions for loan status.

### Customization

- You can modify the Jupyter Notebook to:
    - Experiment with different XGBRegressor hyperparameters (learning rate, number of trees, etc.) to optimize performance.
    - Try other regression algorithms like Random Forest or Support Vector Regression for comparison.
    - Explore advanced feature engineering techniques to capture complex relationships in the data.
    - Consider including customer demographics or marketing campaign data if available in your dataset.

By leveraging XGBRegressor, we can gain valuable insights from Big Mart's sales data and potentially make informed predictions about future sales performance. This project provides a foundation for further exploration in sales forecasting and business intelligence.
